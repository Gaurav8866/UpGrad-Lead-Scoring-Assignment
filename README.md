# UpGrad-Lead-Scoring-Assignment
Group project by Upgrad on Data Science Post Graduate Programme. This project consisted of working on a group basis to analyze the customer data to make a probability classification model using Logistic Regression.

  *Sales Funnel is an integral part of the pipeline for any organization. One of the most important aspects is to know which customers are more likely to convert from highly potential customers to paying ones. The 
   focus and effort should be applied on these customers rather than on the ones who have little to no intention of the purchase. In this scenario it's important to have a pipeline which combines domain information 
   and statisitcal modelling from historical data to create a classification model to help in identifying these customers.
